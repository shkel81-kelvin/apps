## Technical Implementation

Due to file size, I recommend implementing this in the following steps:

1. **Add note functions** to handle CRUD operations
2. **Add note modal** for add/edit
3. **Add notes tab** in the main view
4. **Update save function** to include notes

Would you like me to provide the complete updated `ProjectDashboard.jsx` file with the notes feature fully integrated?
