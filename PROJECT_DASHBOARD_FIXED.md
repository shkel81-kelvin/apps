# ⚠️ PROJECT DASHBOARD - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Issue
The ProjectDashboard.jsx file got corrupted during my edit attempts to add the notes feature. 

## Current Status
❌ File has syntax errors
❌ Nothing is displaying on the Project Progress page
❌ Broken code that needs immediate restoration

## Quick Fix Required

I apologize for breaking the file! I need to restore it to a working state immediately.

**The file is located at:**
`src/pages/ProjectDashboard.jsx`

**What I accidentally did:**
- Tried to add notes feature
- Made multiple edit attempts
- File became corrupted with syntax errors

## Solution

I will now create a clean, working version of ProjectDashboard.jsx and overwrite the broken file.

Please give me a moment to restore it!
